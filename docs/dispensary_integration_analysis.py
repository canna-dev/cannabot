    Reasons to wait:
    1. Current bot already has exceptional value without dispensary integration
    2. Integration complexity and cost are very high
    3. Legal and regulatory risks in cannabis industry
    4. Better ROI focusing on user acquisition first
    
    Better immediate priorities:
    1. Launch current enterprise-grade bot
    2. Build active user base (1000+ users)
    3. Establish revenue streams
    4. Gather user feedback on most wanted features
    5. Build partnerships organically
    
    When to reconsider:
    - After achieving 5,000+ active users
    - With $500K+ funding secured
    - After legal framework is established
    - When dispensary partnerships approach YOU
